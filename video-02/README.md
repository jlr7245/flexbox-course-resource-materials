# Setup & Tooling

In this video we installed [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and went over some basic terminal commands.

- **Opening Terminal for Mac**: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd>, then start typing "Terminal"
- **Opening Command Prompt for Windows**: In your application search, start typing "Command" or "CMD".

|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Change Directory            | `cd [directory to change to]`                  | `cd [directory to change to]`                    | `cd ..` will go to the directory one above the current directory. `cd .` would stay in the current directory. |
| List All Files              | `ls`                                           | `dir`                                            |                                                                                                               |
| Make a New Directory        | `mkdir`                                        | `mkdir`                                          |                                                                                                               |
| Make a New File             | `touch [filename]`, for ex. `touch index.html` | `NULL > [filename]`, for ex. `NULL > index.html` |                                                                                                               |
| Print the Current Directory | `pwd`                                          | `cd` (no directory to change to)                 | `pwd` stands for `print working directory`. It is handy for figuring out where you are.                       |
